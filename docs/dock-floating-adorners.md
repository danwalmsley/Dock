# Floating Dock Adorners

`DockSettings` exposes an option to display dock target adorners in a transparent floating window. This avoids soâ€‘called *airspace* issues when dragging over embedded native controls.

```csharp
// Enable floating adorners
DockSettings.UseFloatingDockAdorner = true;
```

```csharp
// Via the app builder
using Dock.Settings;

AppBuilder.Configure<App>()
    .UsePlatformDetect()
    .UseFloatingDockAdorner();
```

When enabled `AdornerHelper` creates a lightweight `DockAdornerWindow` positioned above the drag source. The window ignores pointer events so the drag operation continues uninterrupted. The drag preview window still appears above the adorner because only the preview is marked as `Topmost`.

Use this option if dock targets fail to appear when dragging over native controls or popups. The default value is `false` which uses an `AdornerLayer` inside the same window.
